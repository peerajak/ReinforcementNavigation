Suppose you are to build an automatic banana eating monkey robot, how could you do?. Suppose there are two kinds of banana, the yellow bananas which taste good, and the dark blue bananas which taste bad. How could you program the monkey robot in such a way that it selects only yellow bananas?  To solve this problem, let us start with a human controllable handjoy and control the monkey robot manually. We have
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.
, where the **'n'** is the nth botton of handjoy.

In this project, we will show how to write a program, called an agent, to build an automatic banana eating monkey robot for a virtual continuous environment containing both yellow and dark blue bananas.

 



### Introduction

To solve this problem, we apply Deep Q network. In Navigation.ipynb, the Deep Q network algorithm is implemented.
