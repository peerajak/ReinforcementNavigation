Suppose there are two kinds of banana, the yellow bananas which taste good, and the dark blue bananas which taste bad. How could you program the monkey robot in such a way that it selects only yellow bananas?  To solve this problem, let us start with a human controllable handjoy and control the monkey robot manually.
